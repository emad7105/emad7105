### Hi there, I'm Emad ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on __applied cryptography__ ([MPC][mpc], [FHE][FHE], [ZKP][zkp], etc.) & __data-intensive middleware__
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently exploring ZKPs & [lattice-based cryptography][pqc]
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m always looking for talented (Ms/PhD) interns to work on privacy-preserving protocols
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to applied cryptography
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [Twitter][twitter], [heydari.be][website], [Bell Labs][belllabs], [COSIC][cosic]
