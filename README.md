### Hi there, I'm Emad ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on __applied crypto__ ([MPC][mpc], [ZKP][zkp], [PBC][pbc], etc.) & __data-intensive middleware__
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ZKPs & [lattice-based cryptography][pqc]
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on lattice-based & privacy-preserving ZKP
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to applied cryptography
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [Twitter][twitter], [heydari.be][website], [Bell Labs][belllabs], [COSIC][cosic]
